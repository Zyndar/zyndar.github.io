experience with sockets. Adept in Object Oriented Programming and
still learning about the Standard Library and 3D graphics.

Currently learning to combine it with socket.io to create real-time, bidirectional 
and event-based communications between the browser and the server.

Some experience reverse engineering binaries and different applications including
videogames, DLLs, crackmes and more. Very handy in order to debug and optimize
programs.

LANGUAGES
English
Picking up English early on in my life was an important step. I have studied
the International Baccalaureate in Switzerland, at the Zurich International
School, which has enhanced my written and spoken abilities. I have also learnt
about different cultures, and improved my communication and cooperation skills.

Español
Nací en España, y hasta el día de hoy he vivido la mayor parte de mi vida aquí.
Ser capáz de hablar español es una cualidad interesante, ya que compone tanto España 
como todo América del Sur. He trabajado traduciendo páginas web, y desde joven he
estudiado la literatura y la gramática del idioma.

日本語
私はアジアの言語が好きです。　私に日本語はとても面白かったです。　だから現時点で、私は日本語を勉強します。
